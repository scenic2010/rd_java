Do you like stories?
I want to tell you a true story.

After they had entered the house, they went into the dining room.
It was very dark, so they turned on a torch.
Suddenly, they heard a voice behind them. "What`s up? What`s up?" someone called.
The thieves dropped the torch and ran away as quickly as the colud.
Gorge heard the noise and came downstairs quickly.
He turned on the light,but he couldn`t see anyone.
The thieves had already gone.
But George`s parrot,Henry, was still there. "What`s up, George?" he called.
'Noting,Henry' George said and smiled. 'Go back to seep'
